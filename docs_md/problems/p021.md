<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=21" class="title-custom-link">Amicable numbers</a></h1>

> Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).  
> If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.  
> For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. 
> The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.  
> Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

Solves this problem

Calculates the sum of the factors of all numbers under 10000.  
Then checks each result for amicable numbers.  
Nothing very special in terms of calculations.
