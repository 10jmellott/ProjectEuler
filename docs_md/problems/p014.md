<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=14" class="title-custom-link">Longest Collatz sequence</a></h1>

> The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:  
> n → n/2 (n is even)  
> n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)  
> Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:  
> 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1  
> It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. 
> Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.  
> Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?  
> NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

------

```python
def main()
```

<div markdown="1" style="margin-left: 30px;">

Solves this problem

Utilizes memoization of the results of the collatz chains and 
calculated for each value under 1000000
