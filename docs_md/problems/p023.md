<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=23" class="title-custom-link">Non-abundant sums</a></h1>

> A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. 
> For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 
> 28 is a perfect number.  
> A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called 
> abundant if this sum exceeds n.  
> As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be 
> written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that 
> all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this 
> upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest 
> number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.  
> Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

Solves this problem

There are probably better solutions to this.  
Step 1: Calculate all abundant numbers < 28124  
Step 2: Sum ALL combinations of these and place into a SET (important)  
Step 3: Check each number < 28124 if it is in the set above and sum the values that aren't  

Note: This relies HEAVILY on attributes of sets to quickly index values
