<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=17" class="title-custom-link">Number letter counts</a></h1>

> If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 
> 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.  
> If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, 
> how many letters would be used?  
> NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 
> letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out 
> numbers is in compliance with British usage.
