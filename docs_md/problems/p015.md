<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=15" class="title-custom-link">Lattice paths</a></h1>

> Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, 
> there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.  
> How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Solves this problem

This requires a very small bit of dynamic programming to determine 
that a given vertex has the sum of the routes to its right and bottom values.  
Furthermore this is then calculated by determining the edges have only 1 path 
available and calculating the matrix from the bottom right corner in.
