<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=22" class="title-custom-link">Names scores</a></h1>

> Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing 
> over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working 
> out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position 
> in the list to obtain a name score.  
> For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 
> 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score 
> of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.  
> What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
