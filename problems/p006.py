The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,  
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025  
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.  
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
